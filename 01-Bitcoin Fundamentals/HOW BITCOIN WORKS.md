## How Bitcoin Works  
### Compared to Commodity Money and Fiat Money
---

To understand how Bitcoin works, it helps to compare it with the two types of money humans have relied on before:  
**commodity money** and **fiat money**.

Each of them answers the same question in a different way:  
**Who creates money, who controls it, and how do we know it is real?**

---

### 1. Commodity Money (Gold, Silver, Physical Goods)

For most of history, money was something you could **touch**.

Gold, silver, shells, and other scarce goods became money because they had physical properties:
- they were hard to find  
- hard to fake  
- and costly to produce  

In this system:
- **Creation** happens through physical work (mining, refining, transport)  
- **Verification** happens through human inspection (weight, purity, authenticity)  
- **Control** is limited by nature itself (there is only so much gold in the ground)  

The strength of commodity money is that no one can create it out of nothing.  
Its weakness is that it is slow, heavy, and difficult to move across distance.

### 2. Fiat Money (Modern Currencies)

Fiat money is different.  
It is not valuable because of its physical form, but because a government declares it to be valid for payments and taxes.

In this system:
- **Creation** happens through institutions (central banks and the banking system)  
- **Verification** happens through trusted authorities and legal frameworks  
- **Control** is centralized  

Fiat money is fast, flexible, and easy to use in a modern economy.  
But it depends entirely on **trust**:  
trust that institutions will manage supply responsibly,  
trust that records are accurate,  
trust that access will remain available.

### 3. Bitcoin (Digital Scarcity)

Bitcoin introduces a third model: **digital scarcity**.

It is not backed by a physical object.  
It is not issued by a state.

Instead, it is defined by **rules enforced by a network**.

In Bitcoin:
- **Creation** happens through mining, following strict protocol rules  
- **Verification** happens through independent nodes checking every transaction and block  
- **Control** is distributed across anyone who chooses to participate  

New bitcoins can only be created according to a fixed schedule.  
Transactions are only accepted if they follow the rules.  
No single participant can override the system.

### The Ledger Comparison

You can think of all three systems as different ways of keeping a ledger.

With **commodity money**, the "ledger" is physical reality.  
Whoever holds the gold, owns the value.

With **fiat money**, the ledger is maintained by institutions.  
Your balance exists in databases you do not control.

With **Bitcoin**, the ledger is **public and shared**.  
Anyone can download it.  
Anyone can verify it.  
No one owns it.

### How Value Moves

In commodity systems, value moves by **physical transfer**.  
In fiat systems, value moves by **institutional permission**.  
In Bitcoin, value moves by **cryptographic proof**.

You do not ask for approval.  
You present a valid signature.

If the signature is correct and the rules are followed, the network accepts it.

### The Core Difference

Bitcoin introduces something new:  
a monetary system where **scarcity, ownership, and transfer** are enforced by **mathematics and open verification**, rather than by physical limits or institutional authority.

Commodity money is secured by nature.  
Fiat money is secured by law.  
Bitcoin is secured by **code and consensus**.

---

Understanding this comparison helps clarify what Bitcoin actually does.

It takes the **scarcity of commodities**,  
the **speed of digital systems**,  
and combines them into a network where anyone can verify the rules for themselves.
