What Is the Biggest Problem with the Systems We Trust Today?
---
Before I begin this discussion, I want to ask you something first. Please answer this question honestly:

“How much do you trust something that is managed systemically by an individual or a particular group?”

Today, we place our trust in systems managed by institutions. One clear example is banking. We store our money in banks, no matter the amount—whether it comes from work, business, gifts, or any other source.

Why do we trust banks with our money?
Simple. Because for hundreds of years, humans have trusted banks as places to store money.
But the real question is: is the system we trust today truly perfect?

Before you answer yes or no, let’s think for a moment.
Who actually manages the banking system? Is it computers? Smart machines that calculate your money every day? That doesn’t seem quite right. Why? Because such systems still require strong management and oversight by a group of humans, directly and centrally. In other words, no matter how advanced a bank’s technology is, there will always be a centralized party in control.

If we think critically, we understand one simple fact: no human is perfect. Humans have ego and personal interests. Right?
If that’s the case, we arrive at the next question:

“What happens if the people who manage our money are also capable of manipulating the very system they created?”

This is where the crisis begins.

Have we ever thought about what happens if the place where we store our money runs into serious problems, and the managers are unable to fix them? One thing is certain: we lose access to our money. This is the core problem of “trusted systems” like banking. Once they fail, we feel the consequences directly. That is the price of trust.

Not everything we trust is beautiful. Sometimes we trust systems that are not necessarily good, simply because we follow social norms as they exist today. Remember: whenever we place trust in something, there will always be consequences. Now imagine the consequences of trusting something that looks good only because most people follow it, or because it is wrapped in sweet promises, while behind the scenes it is rotten.

You would feel hurt after being deceived, wouldn’t you?
And remember: consequences can never be taken back.

I want to leave you with this message: humans are not perfect. As long as something is managed by a centralized system controlled by a small group of people—rather than directly by machines, mathematics, and code—it will always have flaws. Worse than that, you will eventually be manipulated systemically, without even realizing it.
