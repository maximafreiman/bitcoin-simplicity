Rules vs Humans
---
In the systems we use today, almost everything depends on humans.
Humans create the rules, humans interpret the rules, and humans enforce them.

On paper, rules appear objective.
In practice, they are always subject to whoever holds power.

The problem is not the rules themselves, but human nature.
Humans have interests, pressures, emotions, and incentives. When these collide with the rules, neutrality is often the first thing to disappear.

As a result, we live in systems where:

- rules can be changed at any time

- rules can be interpreted differently for different people

- rules can be set aside “for special circumstances”

At this point, rules no longer form the foundation of the system.
They become tools of those who control them.

Now imagine a system that works differently.
A system where rules are enforced not by humans, but by machines, mathematics, and code.

In such a system:

- rules cannot be bribed

- rules have no personal interests

- rules apply equally to everyone

If a rule is violated, the system simply rejects it.
Not out of intent, but because a rule is a rule.

This distinction marks the fundamental divide between traditional systems and Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not built on trust in humans, but on rules that can be independently verified.

Not because humans are evil.
But because humans are not perfect.

And a strong system is one that continues to function correctly, even when humans fail.
