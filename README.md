# Bitcoin Simplicity
Secure your Money and Value with Bitcoin. For Everyone. 

Bitcoin Simplicity is a Bitcoin education project  
covering everything from the fundamentals to the developer level,  
designed so that anyone — including non-technical readers —  
can understand Bitcoin as a whole.

The approach is straightforward:  
Bitcoin is explained based on its protocol rules,  
without unnecessary jargon and without mixing it with “crypto”.
